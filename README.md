The aim of the project is to provide data synchronization between two independent projects.

    1.Data is generated on the server side using random characters.
    2.The generated data is sent to the client through a socket.
    3.A random but periodic delay is created on the server side within a certain interval.
    4.The delay time on the client side is compensated, and data transmission is reattempted.
